# datapalooza-2015

The Silicon Valley Data Science Caltrain Rider app provides an intuitive way for Caltrain commuters to understand their personal train schedule. In the future, the application will provide predictions of schedule delays and relevant notifications for riders' routes. 
The purpose of this repo is present several of the key data science components that have been completed for the app. 
Since the data engineering platform and application development environment are already in place, 
we anticipate that a working prediction model will soon be pushed to the Caltrain Rider app.
